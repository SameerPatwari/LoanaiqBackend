EXPLANATION OF Inventory Days:
Inventory Days measures the average number of days a company takes to sell its inventory.
Formula:
 Inventory Days = (Inventory / Cost of Goods Sold) × 365
Example:
Inventory = ₹20 crore
Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) = ₹100 crore
Inventory Days = (20 / 100) × 365 = 73 days
Interpretation:
A value of 73 days means, on average, inventory is held for 73 days before being sold. Lower values indicate efficient inventory management.
