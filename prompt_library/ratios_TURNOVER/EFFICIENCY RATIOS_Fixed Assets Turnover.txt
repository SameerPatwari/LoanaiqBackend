EXPLANATION OF Fixed Assets Turnover Ratio:
The Fixed Assets Turnover Ratio measures how efficiently a company generates revenue from its fixed assets (property, plant, and equipment). A higher ratio indicates better asset utilization.
Formula:
Fixed Assets Turnover = Total Revenue / Fixed Assets
Example:
Total Revenue = ₹200 crore
Fixed Assets = ₹50 crore
Fixed Assets Turnover = 200 / 50 = 4.0
Interpretation:
A ratio of 4.0 means the company generates ₹4 in revenue for every ₹1 invested in fixed assets. A higher ratio suggests efficient use of fixed assets.
