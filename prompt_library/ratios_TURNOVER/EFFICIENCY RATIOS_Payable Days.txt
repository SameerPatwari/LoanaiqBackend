EXPLANATION OF Payable Days :
Payable Days measures the average number of days a company takes to pay its suppliers.
Formula:
Payable Days = (Accounts Payable / Cost of Goods Sold) × 365
Example:
Accounts Payable = ₹15 crore
Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) = ₹100 crore
Payable Days = (15 / 100) × 365 = 55 days
Clarification:
 "In the absence of details about credit purchases, the ratio is calculated by taking COGS into consideration."
Interpretation:
 A value of 55 days means, on average, the company takes 55 days to pay its suppliers. Higher values indicate better cash flow management, but too high may strain supplier relationships.
