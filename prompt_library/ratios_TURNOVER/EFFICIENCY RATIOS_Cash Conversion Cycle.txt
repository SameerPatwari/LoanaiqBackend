EXPLANATION OF The Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC):
The Cash Conversion Cycle (CCC) measures how long it takes for a company to convert its investments in inventory and other resources into cash from sales.
Formula:
 Cash Conversion Cycle = Inventory Days + Receivables Days - Payable Days
Example:
Inventory Days = 73
Receivables Days = 46
Payable Days = 55
CCC = 73 + 46 - 55 = 64 days
Clarification:
 "In the absence of details about credit purchases & credit sales, payable days and receivable days are calculated by taking COGS & Total Revenue from Operations into consideration."
Interpretation:
A CCC of 64 days means the company takes 64 days to turn its investments in inventory into cash. Lower CCC values indicate efficient working capital management.
