EXPLANATION OF Total Asset Turnover Ratio:
The Total Asset Turnover Ratio measures how efficiently a company generates revenue from its total assets.
Formula:
 Total Asset Turnover = Total Revenue / Total Assets
Example:
Total Revenue = ₹200 crore
Total Assets = ₹150 crore
Total Asset Turnover = 200 / 150 = 1.33
Interpretation:
A ratio of 1.33 means the company generates ₹1.33 in revenue for every ₹1 of total assets. A higher ratio indicates better asset utilization.
