EXPLANATION OF Receivables Days:
Receivables Days measures the average number of days a company takes to collect payments from customers.
Formula:
 Receivables Days = (Accounts Receivable / Total Revenue) × 365
Example with Indian Currency (INR):
Accounts Receivable = ₹25 crore
Total Revenue = ₹200 crore
Receivables Days = (25 / 200) × 365 = 46 days
Clarification:
 "In the absence of details about credit sales, the ratio is calculated by taking Total Revenue from operations into consideration."
Interpretation:
 A value of 46 days means, on average, it takes the company 46 days to collect payments from customers. Lower values indicate faster collections.
