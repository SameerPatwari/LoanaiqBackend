EXPLANATION OFWorking Capital Turnover Ratio:
The Working Capital Turnover Ratio measures how efficiently a company uses its working capital to generate revenue.
Formula:
Working Capital Turnover = Total Revenue / Working Capital
 (Working Capital = Current Assets - Current Liabilities)
Example:
Total Revenue = ₹200 crore
Current Assets = ₹80 crore
Current Liabilities = ₹50 crore
Working Capital = ₹80 - ₹50 = ₹30 crore
Working Capital Turnover = 200 / 30 = 6.67
Interpretation:
A ratio of 6.67 means the company generates ₹6.67 in revenue for every ₹1 of working capital.
