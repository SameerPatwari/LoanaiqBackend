EXPLANATION OF TOTAL CURRENT ASSETS:  
Total Current Assets 
• Definition: Represents a company's short-term assets that are expected to be converted into cash or 
used up within one year. 
• Explanation: Total current assets reflect a company’s liquidity and ability to meet short-term 
obligations. A higher current asset balance indicates strong liquidity and operational flexibility, while a 
decline may signal reduced working capital, potential cash flow constraints, or lower inventory levels. 
Maintaining an optimal balance of current assets ensures smooth day-to-day operations and financial 
stability. 
• Formula: 
Total Current Assets = Current Investment + Inventories + Trade Receivables + Cash & Cash Equivalents + 
Short-term Loans & Advances + Other Current Assets 
• Example: 
Current Investment: ₹1,500,000 
Inventories: ₹3,000,000 
Trade Receivables: ₹2,500,000 
Cash & Cash Equivalents: ₹1,200,000 
Short-term Loans & Advances: ₹800,000 
Other Current Assets: ₹500,000 
Total Current Assets = (1,500,000 + 3,000,000 + 2,500,000 + 1,200,000 + 800,000 + 500,000) = ₹9,500,000
