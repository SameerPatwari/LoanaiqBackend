EXPLANATION OF Interest Coverage Ratio:
The Interest Coverage Ratio measures a company's ability to pay interest on its outstanding debt using its earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT). A higher ratio indicates stronger financial stability.
Formula:
 Interest Coverage Ratio = EBIT / Interest Expense
Example:
EBIT for FY 2024 = ₹30 crore
Interest Expense = ₹5 crore
Interest Coverage Ratio = 30 / 5 = 6.0
Interpretation:
An Interest Coverage Ratio of 6.0 means the company earns six times its interest obligations, indicating strong debt-servicing ability. A ratio below 2 may signal financial stress.
