borrower has good performing financials relevant to that bank to provide a loan.  
EXPLANATION OF TOTAL NON CURRENT LIABILITY:  
Total Non-Current Liabilities -Definition: Represents the company's long-term financial obligations that are due beyond one year. These 
liabilities typically include long-term borrowings, deferred tax liabilities, and other long-term financial 
commitments. -Explanation: Total non-current liabilities indicate the extent of a company's long-term financial 
commitments and debt burden. A higher value suggests increased reliance on long-term financing, which 
may impact future cash flows and interest expenses. A declining trend indicates debt repayment and 
reduced financial leverage, improving financial stability. -Formula: 
Total Non-Current Liabilities = Long-term Borrowings + Deferred Tax Liabilities + Other Non-Current 
Liabilities + Long-term Provisions -Example: If a company has the following: 
Long-term Borrowings: ₹2,000,000 
Deferred Tax Liabilities: ₹500,000 
Other Non-Current Liabilities: ₹300,000 
Long-term Provisions: ₹200,000 
Total Non-Current Liabilities = 2,000,000 + 500,000 + 300,000 + 200,000 = ₹3,000,000
