EXPLANATION OF EBITDA Margin (%):
The dataset consists of three tables: Balance Sheet, Profit and Loss, and Ratios. The provided data focuses on the EBITDA Margin (%) field within the Ratios table, presenting key financial metrics across multiple years. Generate insights while considering the nature and significance of the EBITDA Margin (%), based on its financial definition and explanation given below. 
EBITDA Margin (%)
EBITDA Margin (%) measures a company's profitability by showing how much of its revenue is converted into EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization). It helps assess operational efficiency and profitability before considering financial and accounting expenses.
Formula for EBITDA Margin (%)
EBITDA Margin (%) = (EBITDA / Total Revenue) × 100
Example 
Let's assume a company has:
Total Revenue for FY 2024 = ₹100 crore
EBITDA for FY 2024 = ₹25 crore
EBITDA Margin (%) = (25 / 100) × 100
 EBITDA Margin (%) = 25%
Interpretation:
The company has an EBITDA Margin of 25%, meaning it earns ₹25 in EBITDA for every ₹100 of revenue, indicating good operational profitability.
