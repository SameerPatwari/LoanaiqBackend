EXPLANATION OF Return on Fixed Assets (ROFA) (%):
ROFA (%) measures how efficiently a company generates profits from its fixed assets, such as property, plants, and equipment.
Formula:
 ROFA (%) = (EBIT / Fixed Assets) × 100
Example
EBIT for FY 2024 = ₹25 crore
Fixed Assets = ₹80 crore
ROFA (%) = (25 / 80) × 100 = 31.25%
Interpretation:
 The company has an ROFA of 31.25%, meaning it generates ₹31.25 in EBIT for every ₹100 invested in fixed assets.
