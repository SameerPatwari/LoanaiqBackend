EXPLANATION OF Total Other Expenses (% of Sales):
The Total Other Expenses (% of Sales) ratio measures the percentage of revenue spent on miscellaneous operating expenses apart from raw materials, employee costs, and finance costs.
Formula:
 Total Other Expenses (% of Sales) = (Total Other Expenses / Total Revenue) × 100
Example:
Total Other Expenses (Rent, Utilities, Marketing, Admin, etc.) = ₹40 crore
Total Revenue = ₹200 crore
Total Other Expenses (% of Sales) = (40 / 200) × 100 = 20%
Interpretation:
A ratio of 20% means the company spends 20% of its revenue on various operational expenses. A higher percentage may indicate inefficiencies, while a lower percentage suggests effective cost control.
