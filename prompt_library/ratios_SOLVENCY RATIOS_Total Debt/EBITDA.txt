EXPLANATION OF Total Debt to EBITDA Ratio:
The Total Debt to EBITDA Ratio measures a company's ability to repay its debt using its EBITDA. A lower ratio is preferable as it indicates lower financial risk.
Formula:
Total Debt/EBITDA = Total Debt / EBITDA
Example with Indian Currency (INR):
Total Debt = ₹60 crore
EBITDA = ₹30 crore
Total Debt/EBITDA = 60 / 30 = 2.0
Interpretation:
A ratio of 2.0 means the company would take 2 years of EBITDA to repay its total debt. A ratio above 3 may indicate financial stress, while a lower ratio suggests better financial health.
