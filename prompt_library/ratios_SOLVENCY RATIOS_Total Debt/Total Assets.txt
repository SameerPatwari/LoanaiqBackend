EXPLANATION OF Total Debt to Total Assets Ratio:
The Total Debt to Total Assets Ratio measures the proportion of a company's assets financed by debt.
Formula:
Total Debt/Total Assets = Total Debt / Total Assets
Example with Indian Currency (INR):
Total Debt = ₹60 crore
Total Assets = ₹150 crore
Total Debt/Total Assets = 60 / 150 = 0.4 (or 40%)
Interpretation:
A ratio of 0.4 (40%) means 40% of the company's assets are financed through debt. Lower values indicate lower financial risk.
