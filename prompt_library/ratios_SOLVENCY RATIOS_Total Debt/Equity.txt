EXPLANATION OF Total Debt to Equity Ratio:
The Total Debt to Equity Ratio measures a company's financial leverage by comparing total debt to shareholders' equity.
Formula:
Total Debt/Equity = Total Debt / Shareholders' Equity
Example:
Total Debt (Short-term + Long-term Debt) = ₹60 crore
Shareholders' Equity = ₹50 crore
Total Debt/Equity = 60 / 50 = 1.2
Interpretation:
A ratio of 1.2 means that for every ₹1 of equity, the company has ₹1.20 in total debt. A higher ratio may indicate higher financial risk.
