EXPLANATION OF NETWORTH: 
• Net worth Definition : Represents the total value of a company’s equity, reflecting the residual 
interest of shareholders after deducting liabilities from total assets. 
• Explanation: Net worth serves as a key indicator of a company’s financial strength and long-term 
sustainability. A higher net worth indicates strong financial health, profitability, and investor confidence, 
while a decline may signal losses, increased liabilities, or capital outflows. Consistently growing net worth 
suggests effective reinvestment of profits and sustainable business expansion. 
• Formula: Net Worth = Share Capital + Reserves & Surplus + Money Received against Warrants 
• Example: Share Capital: ₹1,000,000 
Reserves & Surplus: ₹500,000 
Money Received against Warrants: ₹200,000 
Net Worth = 1,000,000 + 500,000 + 200,000 = ₹1,700,000
