EXPLANATION OF Return on Equity (ROE) (%):
ROE (%) measures how effectively a company uses shareholders' equity to generate profit. It is a key indicator of financial performance and efficiency.
Formula:
 ROE (%) = (Net Profit / Shareholders' Equity) × 100
Example
Net Profit for FY 2024 = ₹15 crore
Shareholders' Equity = ₹50 crore
ROE (%) = (15 / 50) × 100 = 30%
Interpretation:
 The company has an ROE of 30%, meaning it generates ₹30 in profit for every ₹100 of shareholders' equity.
