EXPLANATION OF NON CURRENT ASSETS:  
Non-Current Assets 
Definition: Represents long-term investments and assets that a company holds for continued use in 
operations, rather than for immediate sale or conversion to cash. 
Explanation: Non-current assets reflect a company’s ability to generate long-term value and sustain 
operations. A higher non-current asset base indicates significant investment in infrastructure, technology, 
or expansion, while a decline may suggest asset depreciation, divestment, or financial restructuring. These 
assets are crucial for business stability and growth, often requiring substantial capital investment. 
Formula: 
Net Block of Assets = Tangible Assets + Intangible Assets 
Total Fixed Assets = Net Block of Assets + Capital Work in Progress + Intangible Asset under Development 
Total Non-Current Assets = Total Fixed Assets + Non-Current Investment + Deferred Tax Assets (Net) + Long
term Loans & Advances + Other Non-Current Assets 
Example: 
Tangible Assets: ₹5,000,000 
Intangible Assets: ₹1,000,000 
Capital Work in Progress: ₹500,000 
Intangible Asset under Development: ₹300,000 
Non-Current Investments: ₹2,000,000 
Deferred Tax Assets (Net): ₹200,000 
Long-term Loans & Advances: ₹1,000,000 
Other Non-Current Assets: ₹500,000 
Total Non-Current Assets = (5,000,000 + 1,000,000) + (500,000 + 300,000) + (2,000,000 + 200,000 + 
1,000,000 + 500,000) = ₹10,500,000
