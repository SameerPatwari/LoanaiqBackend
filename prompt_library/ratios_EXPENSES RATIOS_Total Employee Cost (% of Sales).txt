EXPLANATION OF Total Employee Cost (% of Sales):
The Total Employee Cost (% of Sales) ratio measures the percentage of revenue spent on employee wages, salaries, and benefits. It indicates the labor cost intensity of the business.
Formula:
 Total Employee Cost (% of Sales) = (Total Employee Cost / Total Revenue) × 100
Example:
Total Employee Cost = ₹30 crore
Total Revenue = ₹200 crore
Total Employee Cost (% of Sales) = (30 / 200) × 100 = 15%
Interpretation:
A ratio of 15% means the company spends 15% of its revenue on employee compensation. Higher values may indicate labor-intensive operations, while lower values suggest better cost efficiency.
