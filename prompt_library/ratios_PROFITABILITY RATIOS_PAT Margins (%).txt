EXPLANATION OF PAT Margin (%):
PAT = Profit after tax from continuing and discontinuing operations. . 
PAT (Profit After Tax) Margin (%) measures a company's net profitability by showing how much of its revenue remains as profit after all expenses, including taxes, have been deducted.

PAT = Profit/(Loss) 
PAT Margin (%) = (PAT / Total Revenue) × 100

Total Revenue for FY 2024 = ₹100 crore
PAT for FY 2024 = ₹15 crore
PAT Margin (%) = (15 / 100) × 100 = 15%

 The company has a PAT Margin of 15%, meaning it earns ₹15 in net profit for every ₹100 of revenue.
