EXPLANATION OF TOTAL CURRENT LIABILITY:  
Total Current Liabilities - Definition: Represents the company’s financial obligations or debts that must be settled over time, 
including both short-term and long-term commitments.   - Explanation: Liabilities indicate the company’s financial obligations towards creditors, suppliers, and other

Provision  - Example:   - Short-term Borrowings: ₹300,000   - Trade Payables: ₹150,000   - Other Current Liabilities: ₹200,000   - Short-term Provision: ₹100,000   - Total Current Liabilities = 300,000 + 150,000 + 200,000 + 100,000 = ₹750,000
