EBT Margin (%)
EBT is earnings before tax, measures a company’s earnings before tax. 
EBT Margin (%) measures a company's profitability before taxes by showing how much of its revenue remains as Earnings Before Tax (EBT). It helps assess a company's operational efficiency and financial health before tax expenses are deducted.
Formula for EBT Margin (%)
EBT = EBITDA - Total Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization Expense
EBT Margin (%) = (EBT / Total Revenue) × 100
Example
Let's assume a company has:
Total Revenue for FY 2024 = ₹100 crore
EBT for FY 2024 = ₹20 crore
EBT Margin (%) = (20 / 100) × 100
 EBT Margin (%) = 20%
Interpretation:
The company has an EBT Margin of 20%, meaning it earns ₹20 in profit before taxes for every ₹100 of revenue, indicating good financial performance before tax liabilities.
