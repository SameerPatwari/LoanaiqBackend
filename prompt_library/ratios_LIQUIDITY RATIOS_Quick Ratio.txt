EXPLANATION OF Quick Ratio:
The Quick Ratio, also known as the Acid-Test Ratio, measures a company's ability to meet its short-term liabilities using its most liquid assets. It excludes inventory from current assets since inventory may take time to convert into cash. A higher quick ratio indicates better liquidity and financial health.
Formula:
Quick Ratio = (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities
Example
Let's assume a company has:
    Current Assets = ₹50 crore
    Inventory = ₹20 crore
    Current Liabilities = ₹25 crore
Quick Ratio = (50 - 20) / 25
Quick Ratio = 30 / 25
Quick Ratio = 1.2
Interpretation:
A Quick Ratio of 1.2 means the company has ₹1.20 in liquid assets for every ₹1 of current liabilities.
A ratio above 1 indicates good short-term liquidity, meaning the company can comfortably meet its short-term obligations without relying on selling inventory.
A ratio below 1 may signal potential liquidity issues.
