EXPLANATION OF Finance Cost (% of Sales):
The Finance Cost (% of Sales) ratio measures the percentage of revenue that is spent on interest and other finance-related expenses. It helps assess the burden of financial costs on sales.
Formula:
Finance Cost (% of Sales) = (Finance Cost / Total Revenue) × 100
Example:
Finance Cost (Interest Expense, Loan Costs, etc.) = ₹10 crore
Total Revenue = ₹200 crore
Finance Cost (% of Sales) = (10 / 200) × 100 = 5%
Interpretation:
A ratio of 5% means that 5% of the company's revenue is used to cover finance costs. Lower values indicate better financial efficiency.
